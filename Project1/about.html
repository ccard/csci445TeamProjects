<!-- about.html tells about 2-color game.
     Have to figure out how we are going to 
     incorporate into the project. Open in new
     window or print in the text area under the
     main menu.
     Aslo need to decorate the links at the bottom of
     the text area.
     Finally, there is about 2 cm of free space that
     can be filled with something.

				2 Color Graph is a single player game. You will be presented with a planer graph. A graph is planer if it can be drawn on a plane without graph edges crossing.<br>

				<br>"A planer graph divides the plane into a set of regions, also called <i>faces.</i> Each region is bounded by a simple cuycle of the graph: the path bounding each region starts and ends at the same vertex and uses each edge only once. The number of edges in this boundary is the <i>degree</i> of the face." [Graph Coloring,8]<br>	

				<br>Your task is to color the faces of the graph with two colors, where the same color can not be in adjacent cells. No, you don't need to use Euler's Graph Theorum to solve the puzzle, where Vertexs-Edges+Faces=2.  But, remembering <i>O</i>(|V|+|E|) might be useful.<br>

				<br>The planer graph is on one side of the screen and the available colors are on the other side. Left click on a chosen color and move it to the section of the graph where you want to place it.	<br>
