Features:
We implemented many features in this project the first one we added was a css3 
animation when the page is first loaded so the content looks like it is 
expanding from the center of the page. Another animation is when the about and 
game page buttons are clicked causing a css3 transition to happen causing the 
about and game divs to appear and expand out from the center of the page.

Challenges:
There were many challenges in this project.  One of the challenges was to get 
the css animations and transitions to be triggered by javascript.  Originally 
we had these animations run through javascript but after a few switches between 
the about and game divs the animation would start to flicker.  So we found a 
way to this by switching the class on the html elements which triggered the css 
transitions. Another challenge that we came across was creating planer graph 
faces that where big enough to click in.
